# ABA GTM V3 – A Data-Driven Go-To-Market Framework

##  Overview
ABA GTM V3 is a structured Go-To-Market (GTM) framework designed to help early-stage startups and products achieve market clarity quickly.  
It focuses on identifying the right customers, crafting sharp positioning, and choosing effective acquisition channels—without wasting time or resources.

This project was built entirely during the GTM Hackathon as an original submission.

##  Problem Statement
Many startups fail not because of bad products, but due to poor Go-To-Market execution.  
Common challenges include:
- Unclear Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)
- Weak or generic positioning
- Wrong channel selection
- Slow feedback and iteration cycles

These issues lead to wasted effort, delayed traction, and failed launches.

##  Solution: ABA GTM V3 Framework
ABA GTM V3 breaks the GTM process into four clear, actionable stages:

1. **Market & ICP Discovery**  
   Identify who the product is for and where real demand exists.

2. **Positioning & Value Narrative**  
   Define clear differentiation and messaging that resonates with the target audience.

3. **Channel Strategy**  
   Select the most effective distribution and acquisition channels.

4. **Execution & Feedback Loop**  
   Test, learn, and iterate rapidly based on real market signals.

The framework prioritizes speed, clarity, and repeatability.
